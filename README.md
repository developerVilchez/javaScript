## Loops

Allows iteration. Repeat an action for a number of times.

### While Loops:

Example:
Count up to a 100 monkeys 🐒
```javascript
var x = 0;
while (x <= 99) {
x = x + 1;
console.log( x + " monkey");
}
```

While the condition is true `(x <= 99)` will add one `x = x + 1;`, from the starting point `var x = 0;` and print `console.log( x + " monkey")` for each adition, until the condition stops being true.

Three main parts for a loop:
* When to start `var x = 0;`
* When to stop `while (x <= 99)`
* How to get to next item `x = x + 1`

"Fizzbuzz" example:
* Loop through the numbers 1 to 100
* If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
* If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
* If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

```javascript
var x = 1;
while (x <= 100) {
   if (x % 3 === 0 && x % 5 === 0){
        console.log ("FizzBuzz"); 
    }else if (x % 5 === 0){
        console.log("Buzz");
    }else if (x % 3 === 0){
        console.log("Fizz");
    }else {
        console.log(x);
    }
    x = x + 1; 
}
```

"Nasa" example:

* Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power (50 seconds)
* auto sequence start (31 seconds)
* Activate sound suppression system (16 seconds)
* Activate burnoff system (10 seconds)
* engine start (6 seconds)
* ignition and liftoff! (0 seconds)
* If there's a task being completed, it prints out the task
* If there is no task being completed, it prints out the time as x seconds

```javascript
var x = 60;
while(x >= 0){
    if (x === 50){
        console.log ("Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power"); 
    }else if (x === 31){
        console.log("auto sequence start");
    }else if (x === 16){
        console.log("Activate sound suppression system");
    }else if (x === 10){
        console.log("Activate burnoff system");
    }else if (x === 6){
        console.log("engine start");
    }else if (x === 0){
        console.log(" ignition and liftoff!");
    }else {
        console.log( x + " seconds");
    }
x = x - 1;
}
```

### For Loops

> for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression])
> statement
>  **MDN Reference**

Example:
Count up to a 100 monkeys 🐒
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i <= 100; i = i + 1 ){ 
console.log( i + " monkey");
}
```
All the neccesary information is declare in the first line.

Three main parts for a loop:
* When to start `var i = 0;`
* When to stop `i <= 100;`
* How to get to next item `i = i + 1 `

### Nested Loops

One or more loops can be nested inside of other loop.

The First/Main loop will triger the loop, then the nested one will loop until the condition is not longer true, stops, to go back to the main loop, that will trigger the nested ones everytime, until its condiction it is no longer true.

example:
```javascript
for (var x = 0; x < 4; x = x + 1) {
  for (var y = 0; y < 3; y = y + 1) {
    console.log(x + "," + y);
  }
}
```
that will print:
> 0, 0 <br>
> 0, 1 <br>
> 0, 2 <br>
> 1, 0 <br>
> 1, 1 <br>
> 1, 2 <br>
> 2, 0 <br>
> 2, 1 <br>
> 2, 2 <br>
> 3, 0 <br>
> 3, 1 <br>
> 3, 2 <br>

#### Increment and decrement 

> x++ or ++x // same as x = x + 1 <br>
> x-- or --x // same as x = x - 1 <br>
> x += 3 // same as x = x + 3 <br>
> x -= 6 // same as x = x - 6 <br>
> x *= 2 // same as x = x * 2 <br>
> x /= 5 // same as x = x / 5 <br>

## Functions

package up code so you can easily use (and reuse) a block of code. 

One parameter, in this case numIngridients:
```javascript
function cookChiken(numIngridients) {
  // code to do something here
}
```

More parameters, in this case action1 & action2:
```javascript
function doubleAction(action1, action2) {
  // code here
}
```

No parameters, empty:
```javascript
function sayHello() {
  var message = "Hello!"
  console.log(message);
}
```

### Print function

using console.log, like the example above, only displays a value.
good to test code, get feedback and debugging purposes.
`console.log` to test your code in the JavaScript console, just that.

### Return function

Return statement:
```javascript
function sayHello() {
  var message = "Hello!"
  return message; // returns value instead of printing it
}
```
Stops the execution of the function.

### Run a function

Up to here we only have declare the functions.
For the function to do something, we have to invoke or call the function using the function name, 
followed by parentheses with any arguments that are passed into it, if it has any.
`cookChiken(6); or doubleAction(look, jump); or sayHello()`

### Parameters vs. Arguments

**Parameters** are always variables name and appears in the function declaration, that are used to store the data that's passed into a function for the function to use. <br>
**Arguments** are always going to be a value, the actual data (i.e. any of the JavaScript data types - a number, a string, a boolean, etc.) and will always appear in the code when the function is called or invoked.

### Scope

Global Scope: defined at the top level, not inside of any functions. Available everywhere.

Function Scope: variable defined inside a function. Available inside of the function it was declared in (even in functions declared inside the function).

Block Scope: //needs clarification***************************************

JavaScript Engine´ll start looking inside the current function when trying to access an identifier. 
If it does not get any results it'll continue to the next outer function to see if it can find any there. 
It will keep doing this until it reaches the global scope.

Minimize the use of global variables. Can lead to bad variable names, conflicting variable names, and messy code.

#### Shadowing or Scope overriding

This first case will shadow, since "x" it is re-asign inside of the function:

```javascript
var x = 1;

function addTwo() {
  x = x + 2;
}

addTwo();
x = x + 1;
console.log(x);
```

The way to avoid it´s by declering "x" in a new variable inside of the function.
From altering a global scope variable becomes a function scope variable.

```javascript
var x = 1;

function addTwo() {
  var x = x + 2;
}

addTwo();
x = x + 1;
console.log(x);
```

### Hoisting
//needs clarification*****************************************
To avoid bug due to this: 
always declare functions at the top of the sripts and variables at the top of the functions.
This way syntax and behavior are consistent.
